##CTRJ

Hi there, I am Tharisky-john, a Cybersecurity engineer, Project Manager, and Instructor....

I don't play CTFs, and I am not a bug bounty hunter. 

This repo houses some of the projects I've previously worked on with a strong emphasis on not breaching NDA. You are welcome to read and make use of them.

You can reach me @thariskyjohn on X(Twitter)
