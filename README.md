#CTRJ

Hi there, I am Tharisky-john, a Cybersecurity engineer, and Instructor....

I don't play CTFs and I am not a bug bounty hunter. 

This repo is meant to house some of the labs or projects I've previously worked on. You are welcome to read and make use of them.

You can reach me @thariskyjohn on X(twitter)
