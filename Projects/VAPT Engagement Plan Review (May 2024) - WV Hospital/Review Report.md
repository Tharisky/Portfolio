- Network-level, technical penetration testing against internal network hosts.  
- Network-level, technical penetration testing against internet-facing hosts.  
- Social engineering phone phishing targeting hospital employees.

**Test Types**  
- Internal network testing.  
- External network testing.  
- Social engineering.

**Approach**  
- Collaboration with the hospital’s IT staff to ensure safe, orderly, and complete testing within the approved scope.

**Techniques**  
The testing techniques are grouped into three phases:  
- **Reconnaissance**: Includes port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and other reconnaissance activities to gather information.  
- **Exploitation**: Uses tools like EternalBlue for potential root-level access to critical systems, with attacks launched from Pruhart Tech’s network using Burp Suite and Nmap 4.2.  
- **Social Engineering**: Involves phone phishing by feigning technical operations to request domain passwords under the pretext of technical support.

#### 3. Potential Misalignment with Client’s Goals and Practices

- **Risk to Critical Systems**: The plan’s use of EternalBlue to gain root-level access to critical systems, such as the McAfee security server, poses a risk of disrupting essential hospital functions (e.g., patient record management, medical services). This could conflict with the hospital’s goal of improving care quality by ensuring operational stability.  
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: The plan lacks explicit measures to protect patient data accessed during testing, which misaligns with the hospital’s HIPAA compliance practice and its goal of ensuring data security.

### Task B: Evaluation of the Penetration Testing Plan

#### 1. Best Practices and Frameworks

**Best Practices**  
The following best practices are recommended for a penetration testing plan tailored to Western View Hospital:  
- **Define Scope and Objectives**: Specify the systems, networks, and applications to be tested, with objectives focused on securing patient records, medical devices, and critical systems.  
- **Ensure Compliance with Regulations**: Align the plan with HIPAA to protect patient information.  
- **Follow a Penetration Testing Methodology**: Use recognized methodologies like the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) or Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) for systematic testing.  
- **Continuous Testing**: Conduct regular testing to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the hospital’s IT environment.  
- **Collaboration with IT and Security Teams**: Work closely with the hospital’s IT staff to share findings and remediate vulnerabilities.  
- **Retest and Validation**: Perform retesting after remediation to verify that vulnerabilities are addressed and no new issues arise.  
- **Communication and Documentation**: Establish clear communication protocols and maintain detailed documentation of methodologies, tools, and findings.

**Frameworks**  
The following frameworks are relevant for Western View Hospital:  
- **HIPAA**: Ensures compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule to protect patient data during testing.  
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Provides a framework for information security management systems (ISMS), ensuring a holistic approach to securing the hospital’s IT infrastructure.  
- **NIST**: Offers detailed guidance on security testing and assessment, supporting a systematic and thorough penetration testing process.

#### 2. Comparison of the Penetration Testing Plan to Best Practices and Frameworks

- **Scope and Objectives**:  
  The plan aligns with best practices by defining a clear scope, including:  
  - Network-level testing against internal hosts.  
  - Network-level testing against internet-facing hosts.  
  - Social engineering phone phishing against employees.  
  However, the objectives are not explicitly tied to the hospital’s specific requirements, such as securing patient records or medical devices.

- **Testing Methodology**:  
  The plan uses Pruhart Tech’s proprietary methodology instead of recognized standards like PTES or OSSTMM, which deviates from best practices and may lead to inconsistent or incomplete testing outcomes.

- **Collaboration with IT and Security Teams**:  
  The plan aligns with best practices by involving the hospital’s IT staff to ensure safe and orderly testing within the approved scope.

- **Frameworks**:  
  The plan references HIPAA but omits other relevant frameworks like ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST, limiting its alignment with broader security standards.

- **Continuous Testing**:  
  The plan does not specify a schedule for ongoing testing, misaligning with the best practice of adapting to evolving threats through regular assessments.

- **Retest and Validation**:  
  The plan lacks provisions for retesting and validating remediation efforts, which is a critical best practice to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved.

- **Communication and Documentation**:  
  The plan does not outline communication protocols between the penetration testing team and the hospital’s IT team, nor does it mention detailed documentation practices, deviating from best practices.

### Task C: Recommendations and Solutions

#### 1. Recommendations to Improve the Plan

- **Establish Communication Channels**: Include clear communication protocols between the hospital’s IT team and Pruhart Tech’s Information Security Analysts (ISA). Suggested channels include:  
  - Chat platforms for real-time updates.  
  - Dedicated email groups for formal communication.  
  - Project management tools for tracking progress and issues.  
- **Implement Continuous Testing**: Specify a schedule for ongoing penetration testing (e.g., biannually, quarterly, or after major system upgrades) to ensure the hospital’s security posture adapts to evolving threats.

#### 2. Solutions to Address Misalignments

- **Adopt a Standard Methodology**: Replace Pruhart Tech’s proprietary methodology with a recognized standard like the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) to ensure systematic and comprehensive testing.  
- **Conduct Risk Assessments for Exploits**: Before using exploits like EternalBlue, perform a comprehensive risk assessment to evaluate their impact on critical systems. Categorize exploits by risk level (low, moderate, high) and include only low-to-moderate risk exploits in the plan to minimize disruptions to hospital operations.
