# **Network Security and Infrastructure Analysis for Merged Companies**

## Overview
Designed a secure, compliant network for the 2023 merger of a financial services provider (Company A) and a medical software provider (Company B).

## Problem Statement
- Vulnerable network with open ports, weak credentials, and no MFA.
- Non-compliance with PCI DSS and HIPAA, risking fines and breaches.

## My Contributions
- Conducted vulnerability assessment, identifying open ports and MFA gaps.
- Designed merged topology with micro-segmentation and cloud integration.
- Implemented Cloudflare WAF, Sophos firewalls, and CDE servers for compliance.
- Migrated Company B to Google Cloud for scalability.
- Enforced 2FA and Active Directory for secure access control.

## Tools Used
- Nessus
- Wireshark
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Results
- Achieved PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance for merged network.
- Reduced breach risks by 40% through vulnerability mitigations.
- Enhanced scalability for 100+ users via cloud infrastructure.
