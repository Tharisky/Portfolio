Penetration tests are attempts to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit operating system vulnerabilities, services and application flaws, improper configurations, or risky end-user behavior. These assessments have become common across varies industries, as they are useful in validating the efficacy of defensive mechanisms and end-user adherence to security policies.

Instead of approaching cybersecurity from the perspective of a defensive tactical team this assessment will require you to assume the role as a member of an offensive cybersecurity team.

Western View Hospital is a 100-bed facility that has been serving the residents of a rural community for over 80 years. The administration recently completed an expansive modernization of the medical and patient records system in an attempt to provide better care for members of the community.

Before the new system can go live, the hospital administration has authorized your firm, Pruhart Tech, to test it for potential vulnerabilities and to ensure the IT infrastructure can secure sensitive patient medical and financial data according to HIPAA compliance requirements. A senior manager at Pruhart Tech has asked a member of your team to develop a penetration testing engagement plan for Western View Hospital that is in alignment with their goals and follows industry best practices. To ensure the penetration testing plan is appropriate for the hospital before it is put into action, your manager has asked you to evaluate the testing plan, provide recommendations for improvements, and propose solutions to any problems you identify.



Write an evaluation of the penetration testing engagement plan by doing the following:
 
A.  Evaluate the alignment between Western View Hospital’s goals, objectives, functions, processes, and practices and the penetration testing engagement plan by doing the following:
1.  Describe the client's goals, objectives, functions, processes, and practices.
2.  Describe the structure of the penetration testing engagement plan (e.g., scope, test type, approach, technique).
3.  Identify any potential misalignments between the penetration testing engagement plan and the company’s goals, objectives, functions, processes, and practices.
 
B.  Evaluate the penetration testing engagement plan by doing the following:
1.  Identify best practices and frameworks for a penetration testing engagement plan designed to meet Western View Hospital’s requirements.
2.  Compare the penetration testing engagement plan to the best practices and frameworks identified in part B1.
 
C.  Propose potential improvements and solutions to problems identified in the penetration testing engagement plan by doing the following:
1.  Give at least  two specific recommendations for improvements to the penetration testing engagement plan.
2.  Give at least  two specific examples of solutions to problems you identified in the penetration testing engagement plan.
 
Note: Problems can include misalignments between the plan and the client’s goals, inappropriately applied frameworks, or failure to use industry best practices.
