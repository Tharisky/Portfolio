## Cybersecurity Assessment and Mitigation Report for SAGE Books

### Overview

This report summarizes the cybersecurity gaps identified in SAGE Books’ security framework, proposes mitigation strategies, defines critical security roles, identifies physical and logical vulnerabilities, and develops a cybersecurity awareness training program, incident response plan (IRP), and business continuity plan (BCP). The assessment aligns with industry standards such as NIST, PCI DSS, and GDPR, addressing SAGE Books’ operational and regulatory needs. My contributions demonstrate expertise in cybersecurity program development, risk assessment, incident response, and business continuity planning.

### Task A: Identified Gaps in SAGE Books’ Security Framework

An independent security report highlighted the following gaps in SAGE Books’ security framework:  
- **Alignment with Best Practices and Standards**: The security program lacks a comprehensive approach to securing organizational assets, protecting payment card data (PCI DSS compliance), and ensuring privacy for EU customers (GDPR compliance).  
- **Expertise and Compliance**: The information security team lacks expertise in implementing regulatory compliance efforts.  
- **Cybersecurity Awareness**: The cybersecurity awareness program is inadequate, with ad-hoc training that does not align with NIST or PCI DSS standards.  
- **Incident Response**: The incident response plan (IRP) is insufficient, lacking defined roles, responsibilities, and detailed procedures for incident handling and analysis.  
- **Business Continuity Planning**: The business continuity plan (BCP) does not address natural disasters, despite distribution centers being located in high-risk areas without recovery strategies.

### Task D: Physical and Logical Vulnerabilities/Threats

#### Physical Vulnerabilities/Threats
1. **Physical Security of Distribution Centers**: SAGE Books operates distribution centers in California, Texas, and Florida, regions prone to earthquakes, tornadoes, and flooding. The BCP lacks recovery strategies for natural disasters, risking operational disruptions, inventory loss, and revenue decline.  
2. **Retail Store Security**: With 400 retail locations across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the absence of robust physical security measures (e.g., surveillance, access controls) leaves stores vulnerable to theft, vandalism, and breaches, potentially causing financial losses and reputational damage.  
3. **Data Center Security**: Although not explicitly mentioned, data centers housing sensitive customer data (e.g., payment card information, PII) are at risk of physical breaches or unauthorized access, which could lead to data theft, loss, or service disruptions.

#### Logical Vulnerabilities/Threats
1. **Cybersecurity Awareness and Training**: Only 25% of new hires receive cybersecurity training, which does not align with NIST or PCI DSS standards. This leaves employees vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other threats, risking data breaches.  
2. **Payment Card Data Security**: The lack of PCI DSS-compliant policies for payment acceptance exposes payment card data to breaches, potentially leading to financial losses, fines, and reputational damage.  
3. **Incident Response and Management**: The IRP lacks clear roles, responsibilities, and procedures, hindering effective detection, response, and recovery from incidents, which could exacerbate breaches and downtime.
