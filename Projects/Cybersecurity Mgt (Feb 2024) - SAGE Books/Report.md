# Task D
The following are three physical vulnerabilities and/or threats based on the attached “Company Overview” document and “Independent Security Report.”

__1. Physical Security of Distribution Centers:__ The Company Overview document mentions that SAGE Books operates three distribution centers located in California, Texas, and Florida. These distribution centers are critical nodes in the company's supply chain. However, the Independent Security Report highlights that SAGE Books' business continuity plan does not adequately address natural disasters. Given that these distribution centers are located in regions prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and flooding, there is a significant physical vulnerability. If any of these centers were to be affected by a natural disaster, it could disrupt the company's operations, leading to delays in shipping, loss of inventory and revenue.

__2. Retail Store Security:__ With 400 retail locations across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, ensuring the security of these physical spaces is crucial. However, the Independent Security Report doesn't explicitly mention the physical security measures in place at these retail stores. Without robust physical security measures such as surveillance cameras, access controls, and security personnel, these stores could be vulnerable to theft, vandalism, or other physical security breaches. Such incidents could result in financial losses and damage to the company's reputation.

__3. Data Center or Critical Infrastructure Security:__ Although not explicitly mentioned in either document, safeguarding the physical security of data centers is paramount for protecting sensitive information and ensuring business continuity. Data centers house critical IT infrastructure and store vast amounts of customer data, including payment card information and personally identifiable information (PII). Any physical breach or unauthorized access to these data centers could result in data theft, data loss, or service disruptions, severely impacting the company's operations and reputation.

__The following are three Logical Vulnerabilities/Threats based on the attached “Company Overview” document and “Independent Security Report.”__

1. Cybersecurity Awareness and Training: The Independent Security Report highlights that SAGE Books' cybersecurity awareness program is not adequately aligned with industry standards. Only a quarter of new hires receive cybersecurity training, and the content of the training does not fully meet best practices outlined in standards such as NIST and PCI DSS. This presents a logical vulnerability as employees may lack the knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively. Without proper training, employees could inadvertently fall victim to phishing attacks, malware infections, or other cyber threats, potentially compromising sensitive company data and customer information.
2. Payment Card Data Security: The report identifies a logical vulnerability concerning the security of payment card data (PCI DSS compliance). SAGE Books collects payment card information from customers both in-store and online, making it a target for cybercriminals seeking to steal payment card data for fraudulent purposes. The absence of a documented policy or standardized procedure for accepting payments in accordance with PCI DSS requirements leaves the company vulnerable to data breaches and non-compliance penalties. A breach of payment card data could lead to financial losses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
3. Incident Response and Management: The Independent Security Report reveals shortcomings in SAGE Books' incident response plan (IRP), indicating a logical vulnerability in incident response and management. The IRP lacks clear roles and responsibilities for incident response team members and detailed procedures for incident handling and analysis. Without a robust incident response framework aligned with industry best practices (such as NIST SP 800-61 R2), the company may struggle to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents effectively. Delays or inadequacies in incident response could exacerbate the impact of security breaches, prolong downtime, and increase the risk of data exfiltration or further compromise.

# Task F 
1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) serves as a foundational document dictating the parameters and guidelines that users must adhere to in order to access corporate networks, the internet, or any other organizational resources.Organizational assets are safeguarded through the implementation of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), delineating permissible usage of IT resources like computers and networks. This policy is reinforced by regulatory mandates such as HIPAA for healthcare organizations and PCI DSS for entities handling payment card data. 
2. Mobile Device Policy: A Mobile Device Management (MDM) policy is a set of guidelines and protocols that govern the use of mobile technology by employees in the workplace, as well as the measures put in place to protect those devices from cybersecurity threats. Supported by regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate data protection for personal information stored on mobile devices, this policy ensures compliance with data privacy standards. PowerDMS (2021)
3. Password Policy: Organizational security is fortified by a robust Password Policy, establishing guidelines for creating and managing passwords to ensure their strength and confidentiality. Supported by regulatory frameworks like FISMA, which stipulates password management practices to safeguard federal information systems, this policy promotes secure access to sensitive data. 
4. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Policy: The Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Policy governs the handling of personal data, outlining procedures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure. Aligned with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which impose stringent requirements for safeguarding PII, this policy underscores the organization's commitment to data privacy and security

# Task H
1. Project Scope and Planning: The project scope involves developing a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to address potential natural disasters affecting SAGE Books' distribution centers in San Joaquin, CA; Keene, TX; and Cape Coral, FL. This plan aims to ensure minimal disruption to operations and timely recovery in the event of earthquakes, tornadoes, flooding, or other critical incidents.

2. __Business Impact Analysis (BIA):__
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for SAGE Books aims to identify critical business functions and processes, assess the potential consequences of natural disasters on the company's operations, particularly focusing on its distribution centers located in San Joaquin, CA; Keene, TX; and Cape Coral, FL, and determine dependencies and resource requirements for continuity of operations.

__a. Critical business functions and processes:__ The Critical business functions essential for SAGE Books' operations encompass various areas including order processing and fulfillment, inventory management and distribution, customer service and support, financial transactions, and IT infrastructure support. These functions serve as the backbone of the company's operations and are crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and business continuity.

__b. Potential impact of natural disasters on operations:__ The potential impact of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and flooding, is evaluated based on factors including geographical location, historical data on natural disasters, and vulnerability assessments.
