Company Overview

SAGE Books is a retail bookseller that provides customers with a one-stop-shopping experience for books, magazines, and multimedia (music, DVDs, and Blu-ray). During a recent board meeting, the discussion centered on how the company can improve its operations and secure its information and information systems. Board members focused on enhancing SAGE’s e-commerce website, keeping cybersecurity at the forefront of its new website design and marketing plan. As a result of this meeting, the board decided to have an independent assessment of the cybersecurity posture of the company. The assessment was completed by Secure Tech Solutions. This organization uncovered a number of issues with SAGE Books’s security program and sent a security report detailing what was found. (See the “Independent Security Report” supporting document.) 

As SAGE Books’s chief information security officer (CISO), you act as the leader of the cybersecurity department. You are required to review the report and write SAGE Books’s response to the proposed security improvements. You must determine the appropriate actions to take, resulting in a plan for fixing the revealed issues. Your response must be provided in a written report outlining the ways SAGE Books will improve security. This report will be given to the board of directors and upper management, including the chief executive officer (CEO).
