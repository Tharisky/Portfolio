# Vulnerability Overview 
Insecure Service Executables refer to a vulnerability where the executable file (binary) that a Windows service runs has weak permissions, allowing an unprivileged user to modify or replace it. 
Since services often run with elevated privileges (e.g., SYSTEM), altering the executable can lead to privilege escalation.
