# Overview 
Bypassing rate limits through race conditions exploits timing flaws in quota-enforcement systems. By flooding a server with simultaneous or near-instant requests, attackers create a race condition where the system can't update its rate limit counter fast enough. For instance, parallel HTTP requests or scripted bursts can sneak past checks if the server processes them concurrently without proper synchronization, allowing more requests than the limit permits.

This lab contains a login functionality that has a rate limit function but is vulnerable to race conditions. This would allow attackers to perform brute force attacks that would bypass the rate limit functionalty
