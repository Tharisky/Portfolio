# Overview 
Bypassing rate limits through race conditions exploits timing flaws in quota-enforcement systems. By flooding a server with simultaneous or near-instant requests, attackers create a race condition where the system can't update its rate limit counter fast enough. For instance, parallel HTTP requests or scripted bursts can sneak past checks if the server processes them concurrently without proper synchronization, allowing more requests than the limit permits.

This lab contains a login functionality that has a rate limit function but is vulnerable to race conditions. This would allow attackers to perform brute force attacks that would bypass the rate limit functionalty

# POC
The attack started with trying to log in to a valid account with a correct username and incorrect password, to know the number of accepted trials. 
It was discovered that on the 4th attempt, the account was blocked out due to the rate limit functionality.

After the lockout time had elapsed, the login was tried again, but the request was intercepted in Burp and sent to the repeater.

The `password` parameter in the request was highlighted and sent to `Turbo Intruder`, a Burpsuite extension for a parallel attack that uses different passwords for each request that would be sent.

                The group functionality would have worked here, but it would mean that there is going to be a need to have several requests, which is equivalent to the number of passwords in the password list. Also, the passwords would be input manually into each of the requests, which is going to be a lot of manual work and stress

The Turbo intruder was modified to contain the needed Python script for the brute force automation. Due to the nature of the code, the password list would be copied into the clipboard, and the script would make use of it from there.

If there is a successful match, the response would contain a 302 response code, and the password can be manually tried with the user name to get access
