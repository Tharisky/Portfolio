A race condition vulnerability in web applications occurs when multiple processes or threads access shared resources (like variables, files, or database records) concurrently, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of their execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or security issues.

## How It Happens in Web Apps
Web apps often handle multiple user requests simultaneously. If the app doesn't properly manage concurrent access to shared resources, a race condition can arise. For example:

User A and User B both try to update the same account balance at the same time.
The app reads the balance (e.g., $100) for both requests before updating it.
Both processes then write back their updated values, but the final state might overwrite one update, leading to incorrect data (e.g., only one user's transaction is recorded).

## Common Scenarios
1. Database Operations: Two users updating the same record (e.g., inventory stock) simultaneously without proper locking.
2. Session Management: Concurrent requests modify session data, causing inconsistent states.
3. File Access: Multiple processes writing to the same file, leading to corruption.
4. API Endpoints: Rapid successive API calls (e.g., submitting a payment) that aren't synchronized properly.
