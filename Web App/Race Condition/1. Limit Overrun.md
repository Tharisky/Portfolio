# Vulnerability overview
This is the most well-known type of race condition that enables attackers to exceed some kind of limit imposed by the business logic of the application.

For example, consider an online store that lets you enter a promotional code during checkout to get a one-time discount on your order. To apply this discount, the application may perform the following high-level steps:

    1. Check that you haven't already used this code.
    2. Apply the discount to the order total.
    3. Update the record in the database to reflect the fact that you've now used this code.


Limit overruns are a subtype of so-called "time-of-check to time-of-use" (TOCTOU) flaws, and there are many variations of this kind of attack, including:

    1. Redeeming a gift card multiple times
    2. Rating a product multiple times
    3. Withdrawing or transferring cash in excess of your account balance
    4. Reusing a single CAPTCHA solution
    5. Bypassing an anti-brute-force rate limit

The process of detecting and exploiting limit overrun race conditions is relatively simple. In high-level terms, all you need to do is:

    Identify a single-use or rate-limited endpoint that has some kind of security impact or other useful purpose.
    Issue multiple requests to this endpoint in quick succession to see if you can overrun this limit.
