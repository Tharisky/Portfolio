# OVERVIEW 
CVE-2025-29927 is a critical security vulnerability affecting Next.js, a popular open-source React framework used for building full-stack web applications. This vulnerability, disclosed on March 21, 2025, allows attackers to bypass authorization checks enforced through Next.js middleware, potentially granting unauthorized access to protected resources. It has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.1, indicating its critical severity due to its ease of exploitation and significant impact.



The issue stems from a flaw in how Next.js handles the x-middleware-subrequest HTTP header, which is intended to prevent infinite loops in middleware execution. Middleware in Next.js is a feature that intercepts incoming requests to perform tasks like authentication, authorization, or routing before they reach the applicationâ€™s routes. However, by crafting a request with a specific value in the x-middleware-subrequest header, an attacker can skip middleware execution entirely, bypassing critical security checks such as authentication or session validation.


# POC

The machine was scanned using `nmap -T4 -sV IP` , and it returned two ports ( 22 and 3000)

Trying to see what service is running on port 3000, i ran " curl HTTP://IP" and i got an HTTP response, which means the port is running an HTTP service
