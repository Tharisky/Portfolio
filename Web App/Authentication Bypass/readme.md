# What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

There are three main types of authentication:

    Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question, is sometimes called a "knowledge factor."
    Something you have. This is a physical object, such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
    Something you are or do, such as your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors."
