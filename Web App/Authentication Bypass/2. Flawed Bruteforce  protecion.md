   Broken bruteforce protection 

It is highly likely that a brute-force attack will involve many failed guesses before the attacker successfully compromises an account. Logically, brute-force protection revolves around trying to make it as tricky as possible to automate the process and slow down the rate at which an attacker can attempt logins. The two most common ways of preventing brute-force attacks are:

    Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts
    Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession

Both approaches offer varying degrees of protection, but neither is invulnerable, especially if implemented using flawed logic. 



POC: 
1. login with a valid id ( the lab provided one "wiener", if there is none, then you create a new one), then log out, and try again with the valid username but incorrecct password. it was discovered that The website blocked any login attemt if three incorrect combinations were tried.  Then i have to wait for a minute before i can attempt to login again. But if i attept to login twice with incorrect passwoord, and on the thrid attept, i use a correct password, it will log me in, and reset the bruteforce counter to zero. this means that using burpsuite an attacker can bruteforce twice with a correct username, ad incorrect password, then on the third attempt, use a valid credential which will login and reset the counter to zero. this can then go on for long untl till the bruteforce is done.

2. To carry out the brutforce, a login request was sent to burp inruder, and the pitchfork option was selected. Then two payload position, username and passwords were added.
