 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 



POC:
on getting to the website profucts were displayed, with a button to viw their details, and a static image showcasing the product
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772a7bb1-fd7d-41b3-8187-b9ad3c413361)

and checking the source code, this tag was discovered to be the location for the pictures
<img src="/image?filename=64.jpg">

And the image below shows the request made when the image was clicked on
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046e0809-03fb-46ef-b3f1-d1ff63b0708a)


The request was sent to repeater, and the 

GET /image?filename=64.jpg HTTP/ line
was modified to
GET /image?filename=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/2



Final image showing the content of "etc/passwd" which means the website is vulnerable
