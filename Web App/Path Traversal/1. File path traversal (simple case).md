## Proof of Concept: Exploiting Path Traversal Vulnerability to Retrieve /etc/passwd

### Overview

This PoC targets a lab environment web application vulnerable to **Path Traversal**. The vulnerability exists in the display of product images, where the application fails to sanitize the `filename` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to traverse the server's file system and access sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd`. The objective of this lab is to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file to demonstrate the vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability to access the `/etc/passwd` file on the server. The process involves identifying the vulnerable parameter, manipulating the request to traverse the file system, and retrieving the target file.

#### Step 1: Analyze the Website and Identify the Vulnerability
- Navigated to the website, which displays products with a "View Details" button and a static image for each product.  
  - **Screenshot**: Product Page with Image  
    ![Product Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772a7bb1-fd7d-41b3-8187-b9ad3c413361)
- Inspected the source code and identified the image tag:  
  ```html
  <img src="/image?filename=64.jpg">
  ```
- Captured the HTTP request made when clicking the image:  
  ```
  GET /image?filename=64.jpg HTTP/2
  ```
  - **Screenshot**: HTTP Request for Image  
    ![Image Request](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046e0809-03fb-46ef-b3f1-d1ff63b0708a)
- **Observation**: The `filename` parameter in the URL (`/image?filename=64.jpg`) appears to directly reference a file on the server, suggesting a potential path traversal vulnerability if not properly sanitized.

#### Step 2: Exploit the Path Traversal Vulnerability
- Sent the HTTP request to Burp Suite Repeater for modification.  
- Modified the `filename` parameter to traverse the file system and access the `/etc/passwd` file:  
  - Original Request:  
    ```
    GET /image?filename=64.jpg HTTP/2
    ```
  - Modified Request:  
    ```
    GET /image?filename=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/2
    ```
  - **Explanation**: The `../` sequence moves up one directory level, and repeating it (`../../../`) navigates to the root directory, allowing access to `/etc/passwd`.

#### Step 3: Retrieve the Target File
- Sent the modified request and observed the response.  
- **Result**: The server returned the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.  
  - **Screenshot**: Contents of `/etc/passwd`

### Summary of Findings

- The web application is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper sanitization of the `filename` parameter in the `/image` endpoint.  
- By manipulating the `filename` parameter with `../` sequences, an attacker can traverse the serverâ€™s file system and access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.  
- Successfully retrieved the contents of `/etc/passwd`, demonstrating the severity of the vulnerability.

---

### Conclusion

This PoC confirms that the web application is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive server files such as `/etc/passwd`. This could potentially expose user accounts, system configurations, or other critical data, leading to further exploitation. Immediate remediation is recommended, such as sanitizing and validating user inputs, restricting file access to a specific directory, and implementing proper path normalization.
