Many applications that place user input into file paths implement defenses against path traversal attacks. These can often be bypassed.

If an application strips or blocks directory traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename, it might be possible to bypass the defense using a variety of techniques.

You might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as filename=/etc/passwd, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.

 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file


POC: 
The website was accessed, and a request to a picture was sent to burp

The request was sent to repeater, and the input field was changd to
GET /image?filename=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/2
this returned a 400 bad request which means the path traversal sequence is not working

Then the request mas modified to
GET /image?filename=/etc/passwd HTTP/2
and it worked.
