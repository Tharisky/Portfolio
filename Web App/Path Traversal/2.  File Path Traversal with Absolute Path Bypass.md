## Proof of Concept: Exploiting File Path Traversal with Absolute Path Bypass

### Overview

This PoC targets a lab environment web application vulnerable to **File Path Traversal** in the display of product images. The application attempts to block path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) but can be bypassed by using an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). The application treats the supplied filename as relative to a default working directory, making it possible to directly reference files outside this directory using an absolute path. The objective of this lab is to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file to demonstrate the vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can bypass the application's path traversal defenses by using an absolute path to access the `/etc/passwd` file. The process involves identifying the vulnerable parameter, testing traversal sequences, and bypassing the defense with an absolute path.

#### Step 1: Analyze the Website and Capture the Request
- Accessed the website and identified a feature that displays product images via a URL parameter.  
- Captured the HTTP request for an image using Burp Suite:  
  ```
  GET /image?filename=somefile.jpg HTTP/2
  ```
  - **Screenshot**: HTTP Request for Image  
    ![Image Request](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628c930e-dae1-475c-9fa1-f626d607cf0b)
- **Observation**: The `filename` parameter in the URL (`/image?filename=somefile.jpg`) appears to reference a file on the server, suggesting a potential path traversal vulnerability if not properly sanitized.

#### Step 2: Test Path Traversal with Traversal Sequences
- Sent the HTTP request to Burp Suite Repeater for modification.  
- Modified the `filename` parameter to test for path traversal using traversal sequences:  
  - Original Request:  
    ```
    GET /image?filename=somefile.jpg HTTP/2
    ```
  - Modified Request:  
    ```
    GET /image?filename=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/2
    ```
- **Result**: The server returned a `400 Bad Request` response, indicating that traversal sequences (`../`) are blocked.  
  - **Screenshot**: Blocked Traversal Sequence

#### Step 3: Bypass the Defense with an Absolute Path
- Modified the request to use an absolute path instead of traversal sequences:  
  - Modified Request:  
    ```
    GET /image?filename=/etc/passwd HTTP/2
    ```
  - **Explanation**: Using an absolute path (`/etc/passwd`) directly references the file from the filesystem root, bypassing the need for traversal sequences.
- Sent the modified request and observed the response.  
- **Result**: The server returned the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, confirming the vulnerability and the effectiveness of the absolute path bypass.  
  - **Screenshot**: Contents of `/etc/passwd`

### Summary of Findings

- The web application is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper handling of the `filename` parameter in the `/image` endpoint.  
- The application blocks traversal sequences (`../`), but this defense can be bypassed by using an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).  
- Successfully retrieved the contents of `/etc/passwd`, demonstrating the severity of the vulnerability.

---

### Conclusion

This PoC confirms that the web application is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive server files such as `/etc/passwd` by bypassing traversal sequence defenses with an absolute path. This could expose critical system information, potentially leading to further exploitation. Immediate remediation is recommended, such as properly sanitizing and validating the `filename` parameter, ensuring it cannot reference absolute paths, and restricting file access to a specific directory.
