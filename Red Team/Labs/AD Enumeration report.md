Active Directory (AD) enumeration is a crucial first step in penetration testing Microsoft Windows enterprise networks. During many internal penetration tests, we are often given VPN access to the target network without user credentials. That means we need to gather as much information as possible about the domain: users, groups, computers, and policies. This will allow us to identify potential vulnerabilities or attack paths that might give us an initial foothold, such as access to a userâ€™s workstation.

Checking  that the attacker machine can communicate with the target network using the command route -n

## Mapping out the network 
1. Host discovery: this was done to chec out the availble macines in the activev directory enviironmnt usin the command fping  -agq 10.211.11.20/24. Four hosts were returned 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e25dd6-aa59-4c82-9d1c-f7d452803583)
2. Nmap scan: This was done on each of the hosts fond in the environment to enumerate their services and undrstadn their role in the environment
     a. using nmap -T4 -sV -A 10.211.11.20. The  ports and sevices contained in the picture were discovered, 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/949a1fe9-f8d6-4b9d-b8a4-722ccf4150b3)
   This
   b. using nmap -T4 -sV -A 10.211.11.10. The  ports and sevices contained in the picture were discovered
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ac2eed-29f8-43d8-ba49-2d1734671a64)
   The scan confirmed that this is the Domain controller.



## Nework Enumeration via SMB

From the nmap scan, SMB was found to be running on the domain controller and the other hosts
1. Snb enumeration for the DC: using a tool called smbclient
      a. Smbclient on the DC: the command smbclient -L \\\\10.211.11.10\\ we can notice that the smb lsted shares without using anypassword.  there are three non-standard shares that catch  attention: AnonShare, SharedFiles and UserBackups.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6d3a504-952d-46e0-80c5-0d7371cf6ac2)

   b. Smbclient on the other wiindows machine: smbclient -L \\\\10.211.11.20\\ . This returned session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70573a30-bcbd-4f00-88ac-6ccd95477465)
Alternatively, another tool called smbmap.py could be used to enumerate these shares 
   a. using the command smbmap -H 10.211.11.10 on the domain controller, smbmap listed the same share as what was gotten y smbclient eaarlir but this time, it shoowed  the permissions aailale on each sare, and the AnonShare, SharedFiles and UserBackups returned read and write access.

3. Accessing SMB shares: Trying to access the shares with read and write permissions 
   a. Aaccessing Anonshare: using smbclient \\\\10.211.11.10\\Anonshare, the share has nothing inside
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b92d8a-528d-4e45-84a0-7dc3622a4a3b)
   b. Accessing ShareFiles: using smbclient \\\\10.211.11.10\\SharedFiles. This returned a file called " Mouse and Malware.txt)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24766c4-a109-4d2c-94e1-fcf002180056)
   c. Accessing UserBackus: smbclient \\\\10.211.11.10\\UserBackups.  Two files were found here.

4. Domain Enumeration: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory services, such as Microsoft Active Directory. LDAP helps locate and organise resources within a network, including users, groups, devices, and organisational information, by providing a central directory that applications and users can query.

   a.ldapsearch using a tool called ldapsearch We can test if anonymous LDAP bind is enabled on the DOman COntroller.
    ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.211.11.10 -s base
   I got the followwing 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a21cf785-6418-4f89-a2ac-2ad4848de85d)

 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.211.11.10 -b "dc=tryhackme,dc=loc" "(objectClass=person)"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46c0bbe4-d48a-49be-a4f3-cd6fa7ae4b72)

b. enum4linux-ng: Using another tool called enum4linux-ng, and the command enum4linux-ng -A 10.211.11.10

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d228cf31-f477-4fa2-8b72-3b5fc354d63f)


Tools like ldapsearch, enum4linux-ng or rpcclient may return some usernames, but they could be:

Disabled accounts
Non-domain accounts
Fake honeypot users
Or even false positives
Running those through kerbrute lets us confirm which ones are real, active AD users, which allows us to target them more accurately with password sprays.

c. Username Enumeration With Kerbrute: Kerberos is the primary authentication protocol for Microsoft Windows domains. Unlike NTLM, which relies on a challenge-response mechanism, Kerberos uses a ticket-based system managed by a trusted third party, the Key Distribution Centre (KDC). 

We can create a user list thanks to the usernames we gathered with the previous tools.
and then using the command ./kerbrute userenum --dc  10.211.11.10 -d  tryhackme.loc user.txt, the valid accounts were confirmed to be 23 out of 27

The result of all these tools includes alot of info, and the user info were exracted and compiled into the table below

### **Explanation of Table Columns**

- **Username**: The `sAMAccountName` attribute, used for logging into the domain.
- **Account Status**:
  - Derived from `userAccountControl`:
    - `512`: Enabled (normal account).
    - `514`: Disabled (normal account).
    - `66048`: Enabled, no password required.
    - `66050`: Disabled, no password required.
    - `4260352`: Enabled, no Kerberos pre-authentication (vulnerable to AS-REP roasting).
- **Bad Pwd Count**: Number of failed login attempts (`badPwdCount`).
- **Last Bad Pwd Time**: Last failed login attempt (`badPasswordTime`), converted from FILETIME to UTC (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). If `0`, listed as "Never."
- **Last Logon Time**: Last successful logon (`lastLogon`), converted to UTC. If `0`, listed as "Never."
- **Last Logon Timestamp**: Approximate last logon (`lastLogonTimestamp`), replicated across domain controllers, converted to UTC. If `0`, listed as "Never."
- **Logon Count**: Number of successful logons (`logonCount`).
- **Password Last Set**: Time of last password change (`pwdLastSet`), converted to UTC. If `0`, listed as "Never."

## Password Spraying
Password spraying is an attack technique where a small set of common passwords is tested across many accounts. Unlike brute-force attacks, password spraying avoids account lockouts by testing each account with only a few attempts, exploiting poor password practices common in many organisations. Password spraying is often effective because many organisations:

Require frequent password changes, leading users to pick predictable patterns (for example, Summer2025!).
Don't enforce their policies well.
Reuse common passwords across multiple accounts.
Before we can start our attack, it is essential to understand our target's password policy. This will allow us to retrieve information about the minimum password length, complexity, and the number of failed attempts that will lock out an account.

we can use CrackMapExec or rcpclient to do this
1. Rpcclient: rpcclient -U "" 10.211.11.10 -N, then  getdompwinfo
