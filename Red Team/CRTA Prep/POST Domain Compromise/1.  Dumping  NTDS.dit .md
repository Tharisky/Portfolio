This attack is a post DC compromise which means, we have compromised the DC or we have a valid Domain Admin credential.

THe NTDS.dit is a database used to store AD data, and this data includes
  - user info
  - group info
  - securty desciptors
  - password hashes

A tool caalled secretsdump.py was used to dumb all these info from the domain controler, and it tool is a available at  https://github.com/bb00/zer0dump/blob/master/secretsdump.py

THis attack can either be carried out using the attacker's machine + proxychains (needed for pivoting)
proxychains python3 secretsdump.py cyberwarefare.firm/Administrator:Pass@10.10.10.2 -just-dc-ntlm

or
it can be carried out from a compromised linux machine in the domain
python3 sec.py cyberwarefare.firm/Administrator:Pass@10.10.10.2 -just-dc-ntlm

Then a hashcat would be sufficient to crack these ppasswords
