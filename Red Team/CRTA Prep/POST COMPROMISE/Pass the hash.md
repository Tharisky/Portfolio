# PAss the hash Attack 

This report documents a simulated attack on a compromised Windows machine within a network. The objective was to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and perform lateral movement to other machines in the domain. The attack leverages tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping and pass-the-hash techniques, followed by pivoting to other systems using tools such as PSExec. This report is intended for educational purposes within a controlled environment, such as a penetration testing lab.

## Pre-Attack Checklist

Before initiating the attack, the following steps were completed to ensure successful execution:

1. **Gain Initial Access**
   - Access to the target machine was obtained using compromised credentials via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   - Command used: `proxychains xfreerdp3 /u:usr /p:pass /cert:ignore /v:10.10.10.21`
   - **Screenshot**: Initial RDP connection

2. **Disable Antivirus**
   - The antivirus software on the target machine was disabled to prevent interference with the attack tools.
   - **Screenshot**: Antivirus disabled

3. **Bypass Execution Policy**
   - PowerShell was launched with administrative privileges, and the execution policy was bypassed to allow running unsigned scripts.
   - Command used: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
   - **Screenshot**: PowerShell execution policy bypass

## Attack Progression

### Downloading Mimikatz
- Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool, was downloaded to the compromised machine to extract credentials and perform privilege escalation.
- The tool was obtained from a trusted source and executed in a controlled environment to avoid detection.

### Pass-the-Hash Attack with Mimikatz

The following steps outline the use of Mimikatz to perform a pass-the-hash attack, allowing privilege escalation on the compromised machine:

1. **Enable Debug Privileges**
   - Mimikatz was executed, and debug privileges were enabled to access system memory.
   - Command used: `privilege::debug`
   - **Screenshot**: Enabling debug privileges

2. **Dump Credentials**
   - Credentials stored in the machineâ€™s memory were extracted using Mimikatz.
   - Command used: `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
   - **Screenshot**: Credential dump

3. **Execute Pass-the-Hash**
   - A specific account (`app-svc`) and its NTLM hash were selected from the dumped credentials to perform a pass-the-hash attack.
   - Command used: `sekurlsa::pth /domain:cyberware.firm /user:app-svc /ntlm:9b241c87d54a761a08a8cae4252f4dca /run:powershell.exe`
   - This command spawned a new PowerShell session with the privileges of the `app-svc` account.
   - Note: Commands like `whoami` or `systeminfo` in this session still reflect the original machine and credentials, as the attack has not yet pivoted to other systems.

### Lateral Movement to Other Machines

After obtaining a privileged PowerShell session, lateral movement was performed to other machines in the network where the `app-svc` account had administrative privileges.

1. **Bypass Execution Policy in New Session**
   - The new PowerShell session was configured to bypass execution restrictions.
   - Command used: `powershell -ep bypass`

2. **Identify Machines with Local Admin Access**
   - A PowerShell script, `Find-WMILocalAdminAccess`, was used to scan the domain and identify machines where the `app-svc` account held local administrative privileges.
   - The script was initialized with: `. ./Find-WMILocalAdminAccess.ps1`
   - The scan was executed with: `Find-WMILocalAdminAccess -Verbose`
   - **Screenshot**: Machines with local admin access

3. **Perform Lateral Movement with PSExec**
   - PSExec was used to pivot to machines where the `app-svc` account had local admin privileges.

   - Lateral movement was successfully performed to the following machines:
     - **Machine 1**: IP `10.10.10.2`
       - **Screenshot**: Lateral movement to 10.10.10.2

     - **Machine 2**: IP `10.10.10.3`
       - **Screenshot**: Lateral movement to 10.10.10.3

## Conclusion

This simulated attack demonstrates a complete workflow for compromising a Windows machine, escalating privileges using Mimikatz, and performing lateral movement within a network. Key techniques included credential dumping, pass-the-hash attacks, and the use of PSExec for pivoting. The attack highlights the importance of securing credentials, enforcing strong execution policies, and monitoring for unauthorized lateral movement.

**Recommendations**:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect credentials.
- Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Monitor PowerShell execution and network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Restrict administrative privileges to minimize the impact of compromised accounts.

This report is part of a controlled penetration testing exercise and should not be replicated in unauthorized environments.
